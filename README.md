#  Streaming Wars: An Analytical Study of Age Restrictions and Ratings on Netflix vs. Disney+

### 📘 University Project — Data Analytics | Python | Visualization

This project explores the **differences in age restrictions and audience ratings** between two major streaming platforms — **Netflix** and **Disney+**.  
Using Python, data visualization, and hypothesis testing, this study examines whether there is a statistically significant difference between both platforms in terms of **content maturity** and **viewer ratings**.



## 🧠 Project Overview

With the streaming market booming, understanding content demographics and audience feedback is critical.  
This project aims to:

- Analyze **age-based content distribution** on Netflix vs. Disney+  
- Compare **Rotten Tomatoes ratings** across both platforms  
- Perform **statistical hypothesis testing** to find significant differences  
- Visualize the results through clear, data-driven charts  

All work was completed as part of a **university data analytics project**, emphasizing reproducibility, clarity, and good coding practice.

## 📈 Results Summary

Netflix has a broader range of mature content (16+ and 18+).

Disney+ primarily features family-oriented titles (7+ and 13+).

Rotten Tomatoes ratings skew higher for Disney+ content, possibly due to brand and audience demographics.

Hypothesis testing confirmed significant differences between the platforms for both age and rating distributions.
